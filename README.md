# Assignment Guidelines
This assignment will serve as additional review for all the content we've covered so far. You will be asked to code some examples, as well as answer conceptual questions found inside this README. Conceptual questions will be marked with [YOUR ANSWER HERE], and you should replace that box with your response. You will do this assignment alone and in class. Your instructors will be available to answer questions you have about how questions are worded, etc. You'll have until lunch, and graded feedback will be given after the break. Please don't look any answers up, as it is in your best benefit to attempt this without any aid. It isn't graded in the "determines my standing in the cohort" sense, but rather just for reflection.
